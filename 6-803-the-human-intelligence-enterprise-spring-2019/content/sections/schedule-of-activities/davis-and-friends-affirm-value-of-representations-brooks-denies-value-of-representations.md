Assignment
----------

\[Note: If you discuss the paper or the assignment with another student—which we encourage—indicate whom you have talked with in your submitted composition. Of course your submitted composition must be written entirely by you.\]

On a total of one side of one sheet of paper, using 10 pt type or larger, with standard interline spacing and margins, respond to all the following:

### Part I

On second thought, we want you to use both sides of your sheet of paper. On one side, construct a broken glass diagram for one of the papers. You need only cover the main points, and you can be quite telegraphic. We are looking at structure, not fine-grain detail.

### Part II

*   You have a nightmare. You have become Professor Winston's graduate student! He is busy, so he asks you to read the assigned papers and let him know if he should read them. Construct an email message directed at Professor Winston starting with “I liked the Brooks paper because....” Be sure to include a bulletized list of contributions; use sanctioned verbs.
*   Repeat for the Davis, Shrobe, Szolovits paper.
*   Construct an email message starting with “I disliked the Brooks paper because....”
*   Repeat for the Davis, Shrobe, Szolovits paper.
